# Greetr

A simple and frienldy javascript lib that reuses jQuery and sets hello as part of the dom.

### Why?

Getting to learn a little bit more of how javascript code can be structured by doing simple things.

Want to imitate jQuery structure so that we don't have to call new everytime that we call Greetr.
