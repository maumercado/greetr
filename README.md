# Greetr

A simple and frienldy javascript lib that reuses jQuery and sets hello as part of the dom.

### Why?

Simple exercise to learn a little bit more of other javascript structures/patterns by doing a simple API.

Want to imitate jQuery structure so that we don't have to call new everytime that we call Greetr.
